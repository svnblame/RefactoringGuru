## Facade

**Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

While Facade decreases the overall complexity of the application, is also helps to move unwanted dependencies to one place.

**Usage examples:** The Facade pattern is commonly used in PHP applications, where the facade classes simplify the work with complex libraries or APIs.

**Identification:** Facade can be recongnized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes. Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.
